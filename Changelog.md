# ANN Basic 
on the nootbook i use () this nootbook to get a better idea the changes that i made where:
- Add new hidden layers to see how accurancy does the model imprpove.

- As well try tanh in the activation function to see the accurancy  of it insted of using the relu activation function .


# CNN Apple and Tomatoes
-Added more layers to the relu activation to see if the accurancy increase , current accurancy is 65%.Deeper network: 6 convolutional layers instead of 5.

- Changed the activation from relu  to LeakyReLU to see how accurancy the model will be after it. The accurancy using relu was 78%

- Added another layer to see if the accurancy increase
