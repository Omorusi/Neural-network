# Apple vs Tomato Image Classifier

This project aims to build a deep learning model that can predict whether an image is of an apple or a tomato. The challenge is that both apples and tomatoes are red and share many visual similarities, making it harder for a model to distinguish between them. However, by training a convolutional neural network (CNN), we can leverage the model's ability to learn hierarchical features from images and effectively classify them

## Objective
The goal of this project is to train a machine learning model that can take an image as input and predict whether the image contains an apple or a tomato. This is a binary classification problem, where the model learns to differentiate between two categories: apples and tomatoes.

## Notebook 
I used this notebook to have a better understanding o fhow the model works (https://github.com/Omorusi/Neural-network/blob/main/Copy_of_Cat_Dog_classifier_CNN_(1).ipynb)

## Techonologies 
- PyTorch: The core library for building and training the model, providing dynamic computation graphs and GPU support.
- Torchvision: Used for image transformations like resizing, normalization, and data augmentation
- PIL (Pillow): Used for image processing tasks such as opening, resizing, and manipulating images.
- Matplotlib: Visualizes images and predictions during testing.
- Kagglehub: Downloads the Apple vs Tomato dataset directly from Kaggle.( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/apples-or-tomatoes-image-classification )

  ## Steps during the model
 -  Dataset Collection: Apple vs Tomato dataset downloaded using Kagglehub.

##  Others models 
-These are some of the model of neural network that i been working on :

### ANN Basic 
ANN basic( https://github.com/Omorusi/Neural-network/blob/main/Basic_ANN(Copy).ipynb)
-I experimented with the activation function in the basic ANN model from this repository. Initially, the model used ReLU, and I wanted to see how the accuracy would change if I replaced it with Tanh.

 I used this notebook(https://github.com/dcavar/python-tutorial-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/Neural%20Network%20Example%20with%20Keras.ipynb) to get a better understanding of neural networks. 

### CNN
CNN (https://github.com/Omorusi/Neural-network/blob/main/RNN_With_Chatgpt.ipynb)
-this a model using chapgpt to see how using AI could speed up creating models.
